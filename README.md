# ATLIQO-S-Telecom-Function-Data-Analysis
In my recent project, I successfully completed ATLIQO's Telecom: Executive Management, where I took the lead in comprehending the problem statement and identifying the essential metrics that needed to be determined. To ensure data accuracy, I performed thorough data cleansing using Power BI, meticulously addressing any errors or null values present in the dataset. Additionally, I leveraged DAX queries to derive new columns and calculate new measures, enhancing the overall data analysis process.

By establishing meaningful relationships with other relevant tables, I effectively integrated disparate data sources, enabling comprehensive insights. Finally, I visually represented the analyzed data through an intuitive dashboard, providing a clear and concise overview of the project's findings. Throughout the project, I diligently explored and interpreted the visualized data, drawing actionable insights and key observations that contributed to informed decision-making.

Overall, this project allowed me to demonstrate my expertise in data analysis, cleansing, visualization, and deriving valuable insights. Through my efforts, ATLIQO's Telecom: Executive Management project benefited from improved data quality, enhanced reporting capabilities, and actionable insights for effective executive decision-making.
